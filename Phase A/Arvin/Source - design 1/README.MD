## Design 1 Visualization

### This visual was created in Microsoft Power BI

[optional]
Download and load the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd/data) in Power BI.

The visual should be readily avaliable in the file when you will open it.

Since the dataset is approx. 160MB in size, in order to not bloat the rar file unnecessarily, I've decided to removed the majority of unused columns from the dataset in Power BI.
